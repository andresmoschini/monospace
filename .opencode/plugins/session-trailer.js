// Carries the OpenCode session id into the commit message, the way ADR-0006 and ADR-0007 arranged
// it for Claude Code. That hook reads `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which Claude Code exports into the
// environment of its own shell tools; OpenCode exports nothing of the kind, which was measured
// rather than assumed — the only `OPENCODE_*` variable in a session's environment is
// `OPENCODE_TERMINAL`. So the id is captured here and injected into the shells the agent creates.
//
// The two hooks do one job between them. `context` runs immediately before an agent model request
// and carries the session id, so the value below is the session that is about to act rather than
// whichever one started last. `shell.create.before` then puts it in the environment of every shell
// the agent spawns, and `git commit` inherits it as a child of that shell. The alternative — writing
// the id to a file and having `commit-msg` read it — is what ADR-0006 rejected for Claude Code, and
// the reasoning holds unchanged: several sessions can be open on one checkout, and "the last id
// written" is not the same thing as "the one committing".
//
// Two registrations rather than one, because a plugin file that throws takes its own behaviour
// down with it: install-git-hooks.js must keep working whether or not this one loads.
//
// There is no `import { Plugin } from "@opencode/plugin"` here, for the reason
// install-git-hooks.js gives at length: on 2.0.16 that package is unresolvable from this
// directory, so importing it stopped this file from loading at all. A default export carrying
// `id` and `setup` is the whole contract. See ADR-0058's revisions.
